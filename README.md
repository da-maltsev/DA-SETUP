# DA-files

My humble setup highly inspired by DHH's Omakub.
Works great on EndeavourOS with Gnome (probably will work on other Arch-based distros with gnome too)

To set everything up just do:
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/da-maltsev/da-files.git ~/.local/share/da-files
cd ~/.local/share/da-files
chmod +x boot.sh
./boot.sh
```
